### statistical modelling of time series data 

## Introduction

The main goal of this analysis is to study how important events affect Brent oil prices. 
This will focus on finding out how changes in oil prices are linked to big events like political decisions, conflicts in oil-producing regions, global economic sanctions, and 
changes in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) policies. The aim is to provide clear insights that can help 
investors, analysts, and policymakers understand and react to these price changes better.
